Cinder-Warping
==============

A Cinder block that enables you to easily create editable bi-linear and perspective warps, or a combination of the two.


#####Adding this block to Cinder
This block is meant to be used with version 0.8.3 (or higher) of Cinder.

Cinder's tool for setting up empty projects, TinderBox, has been revamped and now supports a neat system for the management of plug-ins called Cinder Blocks. This Warping block supports this new feature. To add this block to your copy of Cinder, so it will be detected automatically by TinderBox:
* Open a command window (or Terminal)
* Switch to the disk containing the Cinder root folder, e.g.: ```d:```
* Browse to the Cinder root folder: ```cd path\to\cinder_master```
* Add the Warping block to the blocks folder: ```git clone https://github.com/paulhoux/Cinder-Warping.git blocks/Warping```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a [ZIP-file](https://github.com/paulhoux/Cinder-Warping/zipball/master) and manually add the files to a "cinder_master\blocks\Warping" folder.
